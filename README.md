# Shape Challenge

Challenge:
Write a program(s) that will determine the type of a triangle. It should take the lengths of the triangle's three sides as input, and return whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.The solutions that showcase problem solving skills and structural considerations that can be applied to larger and potentially more complex problem domains. Pay special attention to tests, readability of code and error cases. 


This project is built & tested with 
===================================
1. JDK 1.8.0_102  

2. Junit 4.11   

3. Apache Maven 3.3.9 





Assumptions/Notes:
=================
1. Though intial requirements were related to triangle, it was designed in such a way that it could be expanded to triangle, ellipse..etc 

2. Abstract Factory pattern has been used 

3. Though getArea(), getCircumference() methods were mentioned, but not implemented

4. Empty packages related to ellipse, rectange are created, but left empty for future expansion
